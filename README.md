# python_dice_bot
a simple python bot, which requires the users to enter bet amount, then enter two numbers, if one of the two entered numbers occurs twice in the dice sides (six random numbers), then the bet amount will be multiplied by two, if occurs three time, bet will be multiplied by 3 and so on!

# to add more
